I am a passionate and innovative AI Software Engineer, committed to pushing the boundaries of technology to create impactful solutions.

Currently, I am serving as an AI Software Engineer at [NANU Ltd](https://nanu.tech/) in London, UK. Here, I spearheaded the development and launch of an AI communication coach app for audio and video calls.

Previously, I had the opportunity to work as an SDE Intern at [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.co.uk/who-we-are) in Edinburgh, UK. My role involved leading key initiatives in performance metrics applications and developing NLP solutions to optimize job application processes, which enhanced the system's accuracy and performance​​.

Prior to that, My journey in the tech industry began at [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/) in Pune, India, where as a Technology Analyst, I pioneered an NLP chatbot for Aetna using deep learning, leading to significant cost reductions and improved user experience​​.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am an avid contributor to the tech community. I am also a recognized leader, having led my team to victory in the Code for Good Hackathon at [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global)​​.
